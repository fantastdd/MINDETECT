Changes since release 1418:
- Major code refactoring
- Search with nogoods and restarts
- Speed and scalability improvements

Changes since release 1417:
- Ability to compile GQR into a C library (based on the GObject framework)
- Minor bugfixes for gcc-4.5, data search path, memory leaks, unit tests and waf

Changes since release 1298:
- Automatically compute the splitting of relations into tractable relations on startup, instead of relying on precomputed files
- Enforce total order on relations within WeightValueOrder
- Replace std::priority_queue with heap-based queue that supports decrease-key operations in weighted algebraic closure
- Remove std::tr1 dependency; GQR now ships with a HashSet class
- Minor bugfixes for input file handling

Changes since release 1200:
- Multiple relation data types precompiled in binary
- Use trailing-like history to reduce memory consumption within search
- Enable weighted a-closure by default
- Bugfix for heuristic in weighted a-closure
- Remove multiple heuristic edge queue type
- Make non-precomputed composition use the size-trick; as found in the cache precomputation
- Update the SWIG functionality

Changes since release 1137:
- reduce memory consumption within the path consistency algorithm
- new precomputation architecture for calculi operations (improves constraint propagation speed)

Changes since release 1089:
- GCC 4.4.1 compile fix
- minor search space reduction in 2-way branching DFS with dynamic edge selection

Changes since release 729:
- switched to subcommand commandline structure (subversion style)
- support for combinations of binary constraint calculi
- correctly handle calculi whose base relations are non-serial
- speedup for weighted path consistency scheme
- more edge ordering heuristics
- dynamic edge ordering heuristics
- new default heuristic (dynamic) "weight over learned weights" (a variant of "domain over weighted degree")
- value ordering according to weight of relations
- support for eligible edges (Condotta et al.)
- support for MINCSP calculation

Changes since version 20102006:
- now uses waf (http://code.google.com/p/waf/) as build system
- added support for x86-64 CPUs (should also work on other 64 bit systems)
- new class RelationFixedBitset to represent relations as binary vectors
- added the cardinal directions calculus (cd)
- introduced some variable ordering heuristics to the backtracking search
- removed GUI code and Python bindings (will come back in the future)
- fixed composition table of the occlusion calculus
- fixed the cover files of the RCC-8 subclasses
- lots of bugfixes
